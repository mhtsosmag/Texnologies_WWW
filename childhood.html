        <p> He was the son of Charalambos Kazantzidis originally from Kotyora in Pontus and Getshimani (Hatzidaina) originally from Alaya in southwestern Asia Minor. His father was a builder by profession and during the years of occupation he organized himself in the ranks of ELAS and worked for the Rebel Logistics (ETA). During the years of the civil war, he was murdered by parastatal anti-communists. The teenager Kazantzidis (14 years old) was forced to work in various jobs. The first person to appreciate his voice was one of his bosses, who when he heard him at work at the Esperos factory in 1949, gave him a guitar. Stelios' teacher was Stelios Chrysinis , a blind composer. Manthos Venetis heard from the street the young Stelios singing in his room on Alaias Street and was impressed. Kazantzidis begins to appear in small shops of the time. </p>
        <p>In 1952, Kazantzidis made his recording debut with a song by Apostolos Kaldara . This song was titled "I'm going to take a bath". It was a song written about the heat that was prevailing that summer in the capital. Here the strong influences of Kazantzidis from Prodromos Tsousakis were also visible. Followed by songs such as "Enas magas ton Votanikos", "I don't want your harm (the suitcases)", "Such a doll and a tsahpina", Â¨Apospse fila me", "Society", "White shirt", "My Thessaloniki" etc. .a. where there are great successes and the Kazantzidis phenomenon begins to take shape. The collaborations with Chiotis, Mitsakis, Tsitsanis, Derveniotis, Kaldara etc. are considered timeless, while the number of his own compositions is also significant. From 1953 to he was engaged to Kaiti Gray in 1957. The same year he met Marinella (Kyriaki Papadopoulou) in Thessaloniki and proposed to her that they come down to Athens as a duo</p>
